We purchase most of the components for our retrofit solar energy systems from multiple sources to ensure competitive pricing and\nadequate supply. We also design and manufacture certain components for our solar energy products.\nWe sell our Solar Roof, which combines premium glass roof tiles with energy generation, directly to customers, as well as through channel\ncustomers. We continue to improve our installation capability and efficiency, including through collaboration with real estate developers and builders on\nnew homes.\nTechnology\nAutomotive\nBattery and Powertrain\nOur core vehicle technology competencies include powertrain engineering and manufacturing and our ability to design vehicles that utilize the\nunique advantages of an electric powertrain. We have designed our proprietary powertrain systems to be adaptable, efficient, reliable and cost-effective\nwhile withstanding the rigors of an automotive environment. We offer dual motor powertrain vehicles, which use two electric motors to maximize traction\nand performance in an all-wheel drive configuration, as well as vehicle powertrain technology featuring three electric motors for further increased\nperformance in certain versions of Model S and Model X, Cybertruck and the Tesla Semi.\nWe maintain extensive testing and R&D capabilities for battery cells, packs and systems, and have built an expansive body of knowledge on lithium-\nion cell chemistry types and performance characteristics. In order to enable a greater supply of cells for our products with higher energy density at lower\ncosts, we have developed a new proprietary lithium-ion battery cell and improved manufacturing processes.\nVehicle Control and Infotainment Software\nThe performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs utilize sophisticated control software. Control systems in our vehicles\noptimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging and control all infotainment functions. We develop almost all of this software,\nincluding most of the user interfaces, internally and update our vehicles’ software regularly through over-the-air updates.\nSelf-Driving Development and Artificial Intelligence\nWe have expertise in developing technologies, systems and software to enable self-driving vehicles using primarily vision-based technologies. Our\nFSD Computer runs our neural networks in our vehicles, and we are also developing additional computer hardware to better enable the massive amounts\nof field data captured by our vehicles to continually train and improve these neural networks for real-world performance.\nCurrently, we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and FSD Capability options. Although at present the\ndriver is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle, our systems provide safety and convenience functionality that relieves drivers of the most\ntedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel much like the system that airplane pilots use, when conditions permit. As with other vehicle\nsystems, we improve these functions in our vehicles over time through over-the-air updates.\nWe intend to establish in the future an autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network, which we expect would also allow us to access a new customer base\neven as modes of transportation evolve.\nWe are also applying our artificial intelligence learnings from self-driving technology to the field of robotics, such as through Optimus, a robotic\nhumanoid in development, which is controlled by the same AI system.\n5',

              text: 'Table of Contents\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nEnergy Storage Products\nWe leverage many of the component-level technologies from our vehicles in our energy storage products. By taking a modular approach to the\ndesign of battery systems, we can optimize manufacturing capacity of our energy storage products. Additionally, our expertise in power electronics\nenables our battery systems to interconnect with electricity grids while providing fast-acting systems for power injection and absorption. We have also\ndeveloped software to remotely control and dispatch our energy storage systems.\nSolar Energy Systems\nWe have engineered Solar Roof over numerous iterations to combine aesthetic appeal and durability with power generation. The efficiency of our\nsolar energy products is aided by our own solar inverter, which incorporates our power electronics technologies. We designed both products to integrate\nwith Powerwall.\nDesign and Engineering\nAutomotive\nWe have established significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their components and systems. Our\nteam has significant experience in computer-aided design as well as durability, strength and crash test simulations, which reduces the product\ndevelopment time of new models. We have also achieved complex engineering feats in stamping, casting and thermal systems, and developed a method\nto integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without separate battery packs to optimize manufacturability, weight, range and cost\ncharacteristics.\nWe are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while taking action to localize our vehicle designs and production for particular\nmarkets, including country-specific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces. As we increase our capabilities, particularly in the\nareas of automation, die-making and line-building, we are also making strides in the simulations modeling these capabilities prior to construction.\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nOur expertise in electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering allows us to design, engineer, manufacture and install energy generating and\nstorage products and components, including at the residential through utility scale. For example, the modular design of our Megapack utility-scale battery\nline is intended to significantly reduce the amount of assembly required in the field. We also customize solutions including our energy storage products,\nsolar energy systems and/or Solar Roof for customers to meet their specific needs.\nSales and Marketing\nHistorically, we have been able to achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs. We continue to monitor our\npublic narrative and brand, and tailor our marketing efforts accordingly, including through investments in customer education and advertising as\nnecessary.\nAutomotive\nDirect Sales\nOur vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of company-owned stores. In some jurisdictions, we also have\ngalleries to educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not transact in the sale of vehicles. We believe this infrastructure\nenables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, educate consumers about electric vehicles, make our vehicles more\naffordable, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback.\nWe reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our sales channels. However, sales\nof vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to volatility from time to time.\n6',

For example, we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest\npossible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs across all of our products and technologies as well as to protect and\ndefend our product portfolio. We have also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for\ninfringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made this\npledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting ourselves, other\ncompanies making electric vehicles and the world.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human Capital Resources\nESG\nThe very purpose of Tesla's existence is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We believe the world cannot reduce carbon\nemissions without addressing both energy generation and consumption, and we are designing and manufacturing a complete energy and transportation\necosystem to achieve this goal. As we expand, we are building each new factory to be more efficient and sustainably designed than the previous one,\nincluding with respect to per-unit waste reduction and resource consumption, including water and energy usage. We are focused on further enhancing\nsustainability of operations outside of our direct control, including reducing the carbon footprint of our supply chain.\nWe are committed to sourcing only responsibly produced materials, and our suppliers are required to provide evidence of management systems that\nensure social, environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations, as well as to demonstrate a commitment to responsible sourcing\ninto their supply chains. We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers and we look to the\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidelines to inform our process and use feedback from our internal and\nexternal stakeholders to find ways to continually improve. We are also driving safety in our own factories by focusing on worker engagement. Our\nincidents per vehicle continue to drop even as our production volumes increase.

The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire as trade-ins are subsequently remarketed, either directly by us or through third\nparties. We also remarket used Tesla vehicles acquired from other sources including lease returns.\nPublic Charging\nWe have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are our industrial-grade, high-speed vehicle chargers. Where possible, we co-\nlocate Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable power. Supercharger stations are typically\nplaced along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow vehicle owners the ability to enjoy quick, reliable charging along an\nextensive network with convenient stops. Use of the Supercharger network either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs. In\nNovember 2021, we began to offer Supercharger access to non-Tesla vehicles in certain locations in support of our mission to accelerate the world’s\ntransition to sustainable energy, and in November 2022, we opened up our previously proprietary charging connector as the North American Charging\nStandard (NACS). This enables all electric vehicles and charging stations to interoperate — which makes charging easier and more efficient for everyone\nand advances our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. Following this, a number of major automotive companies announced\ntheir adoption of NACS, with their access to the Supercharger network beginning in phases in 2024 and their production of NACS vehicles beginning no\nlater than 2025. We also engaged SAE International to govern NACS as an industry standard, now named J3400. We continue to monitor and increase our\nnetwork of Tesla Superchargers in anticipation of future demand.\nWe also work with a wide variety of hospitality, retail and public destinations, as well as businesses with commuting employees, to offer additional\ncharging options for our customers, as well as single-family homeowners and multi-family residential entities, to deploy home charging solutions.\nIn-App Upgrades\nAs our vehicles are capable of being updated remotely over-the-air, our customers may purchase additional paid options and features through the\nTesla app or through the in-vehicle user interface. We expect that this functionality will also allow us to offer certain options and features on a\nsubscription basis in the future.\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nWe market and sell our solar and energy storage products to residential, commercial and industrial customers and utilities through a variety of\nchannels, including through our website, stores and galleries, as well as through our network of channel partners, and in the case of some commercial\ncustomers, through PPA transactions. We emphasize simplicity, standardization and accessibility to make it easy and cost-effective for customers to adopt\nclean energy, while reducing our customer acquisition costs.\nService and Warranty\nAutomotive\nService\nWe provide service for our electric vehicles at our company-owned service locations and through Tesla Mobile Service technicians who perform work\nremotely at customers’ homes or other locations. Servicing the vehicles ourselves allows us to identify problems and implement solutions and\nimprovements faster than traditional automobile manufacturers and their dealer networks. The connectivity of our vehicles also allows us to diagnose and\nremedy many problems remotely and proactively.\nVehicle Limited Warranties and Extended Service Plans\nWe provide a manufacturer’s limited warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell directly to consumers, which may include limited\nwarranties on certain components, specific types of damage or battery capacity retention. We also currently offer optional extended service plans that\nprovide coverage beyond the new vehicle limited warranties for certain models in specified regions.\n7',
