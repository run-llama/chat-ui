### Text Part
Text part is used to display text in the chat. It is in markdown format.
You can use markdown syntax to format the text. Some examples:

- **bold** -> this is bold text
- *italic* -> this is italic text
- [link](https://www.google.com) -> this is a link

You can also display a code block inside markdown.

```js
const a = 1
const b = 2
const c = a + b
console.log(c)
```""",

        """
### Parts

Beside text, you can also display parts in the chat. Parts can be displayed before or after the text.
